## Background
Mathis Wackernagel, for his PhD thesis in ecology at University of British Columbia, has developed and promoted metrics for sustainability called ecological footprint.Here are the basic metric concepts:
* Biocapacity per person (in hectares) is the productive area to produce biological materials and to absorb waste material generated for each resident. It is their “ecological income.”
* Ecological Footprint (EF) per person (in hectares) is defined as the biologically productive areas required to provide everything one person consumes. It is their “ecological expenditures.” Each ecological Footprint is further segregated into six major footprints including: carbon, build-up land, cropland, grazing land, forest land and fishing.

## Research Incentive
Based on this definition, a country is in good shape if the subtraction of ecological footprint from biocapacity is a positive value, otherwise, that country or person has “spent” their ecology more than what they can really afford. The goal of project is to use visualization to understand how countries allocate their six major footprints.
